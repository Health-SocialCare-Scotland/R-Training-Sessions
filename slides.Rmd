## What will you learn today?

- RStudio interface

- Reading data into [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) from multiple sources

- Installing and using R packages

- Manipulating data using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) code

- Exploring data using crosstabs and frequencies

- Becoming familiar with the widely used `dplyr` package



## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics

- Widely used across a variety of sectors for data analysis and statistical inference

- R is open source and free to use, and available for all major operating systems


## R or RStudio?

RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. You cannot run RStudio without R.

- RStudio is more flexible and powerful, and provides direct access to R code
- Both are good for viewing data, neither is good for manually editing data
- Use RStudio for any project that requires direct interaction with code and/or manipulation of complex data

## Functions and data embedded in R

```{r,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Easy to plot charts 

```{r,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

```{r}
plot(cars)
```


## R packages 

Packages allow you to use R much more efficiently. Rather than simply relying on some basic R techniques, they build on some widely used R methods and often make complex tasks very straight forward. R packages cover a wide range of needs. 

Try typing:


```{r,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
packageDescription("stats")
help(package = "stats")
?stats
```

## How to import and export data 

- csv
- Excel 
- SPSS
- SMRA


## csv

You can use the `readr` package to read in csv files. To do this, we first need to install and load the package.

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
```

Once we have loaded the package, we can then use this simple command to read in our file

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
csv_data <- read_csv("path/file_name.csv")
```

- An alternative is clicking on the Import Dataset from your global environment section. 


Let's try an example! 

## EXAMPLE

Load the `readr` package

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
library(readr)
```

Read in the `Borders.csv` data from 

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders <- read_csv("data/Borders.csv")
View(borders)
```


## SPSS


A package called `haven` provides a simple function to read in SPSS files (`.sav` or `.zsav`).

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("haven")
library(haven)
spss_data <- read_sav("path/file_name.sav")
```

- An alternative is clicking on the Import Dataset from your global environment section similar to csv. 


Let's try an example! 

## EXAMPLE

Load the `haven` package

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
library(haven)
```

Read in the `Borders.sav` SPSS data

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders_spss <- read_sav("data/Borders.sav")
View(borders_spss)
```




## SMRA (for information only)

Reading data from SMRA is slightly more tricky.


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("odbc") # One time install
library(odbc)
# Set up a connection
smra_connection <- dbConnect(drv = odbc(), dsn = "SMRA",
  uid = .rs.askForPassword("SMRA Username:"),
  pwd = .rs.askForPassword("SMRA Password:")
)

# Do the extract using SQL
smr01 <- dbGetQuery(smra_connection,
  paste("select DISCHARGE_DATE, LOCATION, MAIN_OPERATION",
    "from SMR01_PI",
    "where ROWNUM <= 100")
)
```
Instructions on using R to connect to SMRA can be found on the [ISD Website](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Using-R-with-SMRA-V1-1.pdf)



## Data Exploration - Data Frame 

Let's do some data exploration.

As a first step, it is important to know the size of the dataframe. 


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
dim(df)
```
We can check the number of rows and columns for the `borders` dataframe 


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
dim(borders)
```

## Data Exploration

You can easily determine summary statistics of a specific column in R. For example, we can calculate the mean by using the `mean(df$column)` command. The `$` operator allows you to extract elements by name from a named list, i.e. take only values from a specific column in a given dataframe. 

In addition to the mean, it is also possible to calculate other statistics such as the median value and the range of values (for a numeric column)

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mean(df$column)
median(df$column)
range(df$column)
# For frequencies we can use table()
table(df$column)
```


## Exercise 1:

- Read in the `Borders.csv` data and check the frequency on column `Sex`. 

- Using the same dataset, what are the mean and median values for `LengthOfStay`?

## Data Exploration - Crosstabs

The `table()` function can also be used to create crosstabs from your data. Using the following code will give a crosstab for column1 and column2:

```{r,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
table(df$column1, df$column2)
```

Using our data:

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
table(borders$HospitalCode, borders$Sex)

 # Addmargins() will add extra row and column for totals
addmargins(table(borders$HospitalCode, borders$Sex))
```


## Data Manipulation 


A very common way of manipulating data in R is by using the `dplyr` package. This package exists as part of a group of R packages known as the "tidyverse". The tidyverse is comprised of multiple packages, with each package designed to do their respective task very efficiently. 



```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("dplyr")

library(dplyr)
```

Tidyverse packages such as `dplyr` use a consistent format with the full data set being the first argument e.g. `function(data, task)` we'll see why this is useful later, but generally it should make code more readable and consistent!


## Comparison Operators

It is possible to selects rows (using the function `filter()`, which we'll meet soon) in a dataframe, the table below shows a selection of comparison operators that can be used. 




```{r,  echo=FALSE}
    kable(table_contents,
          col.names = c("Operator", "Function"),
          format = "markdown")
```


## Logical Operators

In addition to comparison operators, sometimes it is necessary to use logical operators.


```{r,  echo=FALSE}   
kable(table_contents2,
          col.names = c("Operator","Text Equivalent", "Definition"),
          format = "markdown")
```

## Let's try using the operators 

Using the `borders` data, get all records with Specialty E12. We can use the `filter()` function to use only specific rows from the data frame. *(This works in a similar way to 'select if' in SPSS.)*

```{r,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
borders_E12 <- filter(borders, Specialty == "E12")
```

Use `filter()` with the `borders` data to get patients who attended hospital B120H and had a length of stay greater than 10.  


```{r,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
borders_filtered <- filter(borders, 
                           HospitalCode == "B120H" & 
                           LengthOfStay > 10)

```



## Exercise 2:

- How many patients had a length of stay between 2 and 6 days inclusive in Borders General Hospital (B120H)?


## mutate()

Often there is a need to create a new column in a dataframe or modify an existing column The simplest way to do this is to use the `mutate()` function. 


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mutate(df, newcolumn = expression)
```

For example if we want to create `LengthOfStay` divided by 2. 


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders_2 <- mutate(borders, los_div_2 = LengthOfStay / 2)
```


## arrange()

Data can also be sorted with `dplyr` using the `arrange()` function. Multiple columns can be selected and `arrange()` will sort the dataframe in the order the columns are selected. 
  

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
arrange(df, column1, column2, desc(column3))
```

We can sort our data into ascending order by `HospitalCode`


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
arrange(borders, HospitalCode)
```


## Pipe Operator 

While all the dplyr functions shown are useful on their own, there are times when we need to use more of them to achieve desired outputs. For this, `dplyr` contains the pipe operator, `%>%`. This operator works by linking the `dplyr` function together. 

The pipe operator essentially means "and then". This makes reading your code much easier, as rather than having forcing several functions into one line of code, the pipe allows you to refer to your data frame and then perform several functions on it. 

A common short cut for the pipe operator is "`Ctrl+Shift+M`".

## Pipe Operator 

For example, if we wanted to get all records with `HospitalCode` "B102H" and sort by `Dateofbirth`, we would have had to run this code:

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
arrange(filter(borders, HospitalCode == "B102H"), Dateofbirth)
```

However, we can make this code much easier to read by introducing the pipe operator:

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders %>% # Take the borders data frame AND THEN
  filter(HospitalCode == "B102H") %>% # filter so only rows where HospitalCode is B102H AND THEN
  arrange(Dateofbirth) # sort the result by date of birth
```

**Note**: There is no longer a need for dataframe as the first argument in each function as R knows you are referring to the `borders` data frame


## select()

Sometimes you will only be interested in a few columns in your dataframe. The `select()` function allows you to specify certain columns from within your dataframe to select out. 


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
select(df, column_name)
```

`select()` can also be used to delete a specific column, you can simply run the following code:

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
select(df, -column_name)
```

Let's try using the `borders` data. 

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
select(borders, -Postcode)
```

## Example 

Select the `URI`, `Specialty` and `LengthOfStay` columns, filter for rows which contain C8 for `Specialty` and arrange by `LengthOfStay`.


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders %>%
  select(URI, Specialty, LengthOfStay) %>%
  filter(Specialty == "C8") %>%
  arrange(LengthOfStay)
```


## group_by() 

The `group_by()` function allows you to easily aggregate your data into groups. This function simply list the desired columns you wish to group by within your dataframe. 


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
group_by(df, column_name)
```
Using our data:


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
group_by(borders, HospitalCode)
```

As you can see, using the group_by function on its own doesn't affect the appearance of the data. However, the output in the console now shows the number of groups within the data 

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
Groups: HospitalCode [48]
```


## summarise()  

The `summarise()` function allows you to calculate summary statistics for each desired group. To use this function we trying an example using the `borders` data, using the code below we calculate the mean length of stay for each hospital. 

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders %>%
  group_by(HospitalCode) %>%
  summarise(mean_los = mean(LengthOfStay)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

If we run this code without `group_by()`, then the output will be the mean length of stay across all the data.

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders %>%
  summarise(mean_los = mean(LengthOfStay))
```


## count()

The `count()` function is very useful for running frequencies on a dataframe. This function automatically calls `group_by()` and produces counts for a specified column.

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders %>%
  count(Sex)
```

You can also sort frequencies in descending order using `count()`

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders %>%
  count(Specialty, sort = TRUE)
```

## Exercise 3:

- Work out the earliest (minimum) admission date and latest (maximum) discharge date for each specialty. 

- Count the number of admission (frequencies) per hospital per specialty, using `count()`


## rename() 

The `dplyr` package also makes it very straight forward to rename specific columns by using the `rename()` function respectively. The `rename()` function works as follows: 

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
df <- rename(df, new_name = existing_name)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders <- rename(borders, date_of_birth = Dateofbirth)
```

If you look at your `borders` dataframe, you will see that the `Dateofbirth` column is now called `date_of_birth`. 

## recode() 

While `rename()` changes the column name, `recode()` changes the values within the column. The `recode()` function works best when used within a `mutate()`: 

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(column_name = recode(column_name, 
                              "existing_code" = "new_code"))
```

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders <- borders %>% 
  mutate(HospitalCode = recode(HospitalCode, "B120V" = "B120H"))
```


## Exercise 4:

- Select the `URI`, `Specialty` and `DateOfBirth` columns from `borders` data and save this into a new data frame. 
- Arrange this new data frame in ascending order by `Specialty` and view it to see the results. 
- Use the `filter` function to work out how many records have a missing `DateOfBirth` value.

## Joining Data 

The `dplyr` package also makes it very easy to merge data by matching files together using common variables. There are several join functions within `dplyr` that are designed to merge dataframes together to create one dataframe containing the relevant variables.

The general structure of a join function is to specify the two dataframes used for merging, x and y, and a common variable to match by. For example, for a `left_join()` you would have: 

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
left_join(df_1, df_2, by = "common_variable")
```

## Examples of Joining Functions

![dplyr joining functions](images/dplyr_joins.png){ width=100%, height=100%}

## Example 
  
Read in `Baby5.csv` and `Baby6.csv`
  
```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}

baby5 <- read_csv("data/Baby5.csv")
baby6 <- read_csv("data/Baby6.csv")
baby_joined <- baby5 %>%
  left_join(baby6, by = c("FAMILYID", "DOB"))
```
  


## Data Visulisation 

A basic line graph can be created using the following code:

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 3, 2, 4)
# Plot the data
plot(x, type = "l")
```

 Note that `type = "l"` simply means to plot a line.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- c(1, 3, 2, 4)
par(mar = c(10, 4, 4, 2))
plot(x, type = "l")
```


## Example 


- Read in the `Borders (inc Age).csv` data

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
borders_age <- read_csv("data/Borders (inc Age).csv")
```

- Calculate frequencies of `admissionday`

```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
counts <- table(borders_age$admissionday)
barplot(counts)
```



## Customising Plots 

It is possible to customise plots created in R. 


- Change the colour and width of the bars


```{r,  eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
barplot(counts,
  xlab = "Admission Day", ylab = "Number of Admissions",
  main = "Distribution of Admission Day", col = "blue", space = 1
)
```


## Exercise 5:

- Filter your data to select records with `HospitalCode` "B109H". Create a histogram for patient's length of stay. Add a title and axis labels and save the plot to your H:/ drive as a PNG. Hint: Use `hist()` to create the histogram
